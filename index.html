	<p style="color:#3E606F;">What can you possibly say about someone like Andy Warhol that’s not been said already by, well, everyone even remotely interested in art? We can try telling his story through Andy Warhol quotes and we can only continue to acknowledge his remarkable contributions to the world at large while his astonishing legacy lives on. Andy Warhol was a true mastermind of his time, having re-defined so many concepts and introduced new ones that became new standards in no time. But it never stopped there – the Warhol-ism is still very much alive and well, and everything that the artist touched turned to gold that still shines, brighter than ever. His pop art, paintings, photographs, silk screens, sculptures, films, music, the Interview magazine, books, all very fresh and new almost thirty years after his death. It is a physical testimony that Andy Warhol could predict the future, something we could also notice from the many brilliant things he used to say as well – “In the future, everybody will be world famous for fifteen minutes.”
