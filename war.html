“Most people in America think Art is a man’s name.” While in this particular example taken from the book of Andy Warhol quotes he might have meant it literally, it struck me as an ambiguous thought. It could point out the general opinion that art is done solely by men and unfortunately, the male dominance is still at the rate of great discrimination. Art will continue to fight for women’s rights, but also for the rights of minorities, of which Andy Warhol was part, as an openly gay man. His iconography is also perceived as an homage to women and it draws from gay underground culture and/or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire.</p>
